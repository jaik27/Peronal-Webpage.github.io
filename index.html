      <h2>Background</h2>
      <p>I’m a graduated Aerospace Engineer. Academic studies have enabled excellent practical competencies in aerodynamics and physics; structural dynamics; systems design and testing; flight mechanics and controls; and 2D and 3D CAD design tools.<p> With a diverse experience  of working  in large design teams  and in the food industry, my key strengths include great communications skills that enable me to quickly build rapport with customers, colleagues, and staff.</p>A methodical approach to paperwork and administration, coupled with attention to detail in handling information, as well as good time management and problem- solving habits. </p>

      <h2>Goals</h2>
      <p>I'd like to Learn more about:</p>
      <ul class="skills">
        <li>HTML5</li>
        <li>CSS</li>
        <li>JavaScript</li>
        <li>Offline websites</li>
      </ul>
      <p> My main goal in life is to own a successful company. This is my main goal in life because I want to be able to be the boss, not have one. I want to be able to do what I want not what someone else wants. My short term goals this year were to pass every semester with B+ and up.</p>
      <p>Beyond coursework, I’ll learn from peers with similar interests by joining the Club, where I’ll contribute my experience from my undergrad to the club’s ongoing collaborations. I also look forward to utilizing Douglas's extensive alumni network to seek out mentorship and advice as I embark on my business finance venture in the future.</p>
      <p>Ultimately, I feel passionate about education, engineering and the innumerable, lifelong benefits it can yield. Even today, years after studying Aerospace, I still use the scientific turn of mind I gained through my studies to dissect problems on a daily basis. Higher education isn’t only about what you study; it’s about how you learn to think.</p>
